    "# Q 6.1\n",
    "Interacting with ChatGPT to understand the Monte Hall Poblem and \"Markovian ChatBot\" code was very helpful as it generated quick, detailed responses. ChatGPT broke down each line of code, carefully explaining the function it performed, and provided concrete examples (ex. concrete words for the Markovian ChatBot) to help solidify understanding. Furthermore, when I did not understand the explanations for the code, ChatGPT was able to regenerate its response and provide more simple, beginner-friendly explanations. \n",

    "# Q 6.2\n",
    "\n",
    "Interacting with ChatGPT to understand the code provided and generate a new code, particularly for the Monte Hall problem, was overall helpful due to its detailed and easy-to-understand explanations, but at the same time also a bit frustrating. The frustration came because each response it generated was lengthy and required a considerable amount of time to read and understand. The heavy text of information produced thus made the interaction more tiring, and many of the responses were redundant.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q 6.3\n",
    "Based on my experience with using ChatGPT, I think that it is highly effective and useful for understanding code, as it can tailor explanations to your level of understanding if you specify it. Furthermore, ChatGPT easily troubleshoots coding errors and is able to produce working code (with explanations), which aids a beginner in learning the technical aspects and the meaning of each line of code. While responses can be lengthy, ChatGPT can generate shorter answers if you request it. However, it's important to note that shorter explanations might sometimes omit crucial details required for understanding.\n",

ChatGPT has given me more \"flexibility\" in making coding mistakes, as it can easily find my coding errors and give me feedback on how to correct them. Furthermore, it is a very useful tool in effectively handling follow-up questions and helping me fill in the gaps in my learning. \n",

    "Since joining the STA130 course, my perception of using AI-driven tools for learning coding, statistics, and data science has improved as I can actively engage with the chatbot to get clarification and understand difficult concepts. However, I still do think that chatbots should be used more as a supplemental tool instead of basing our learning of coding, statistics, and data science solely on it. This is due to the fact that there are often variations in the code chatbot generates, and without a strong foundational understanding of the concepts, it is very easy for a beginner like me to \"get lost\" despite the simple explanations the chatbot provides. \n",
