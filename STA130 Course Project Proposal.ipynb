    "# Proposal for STA130 Course Project on Canadian Social Connection Survey (CSCS) Data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Group Proposal:** I would like to work with Michelle and Saanvi, who are two students in the same tutorial group as me.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Proposal I: Relationship between Social Activities with Family Members and Mental Well-Being\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Research Question**: How does the frequency of visiting family members relate to Canadians' mental health?\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Variables:** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**a) CONNECTION_activities_visited_family_p3m** (Independent Variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "This variable categorizes the frequency of family visits in the past 3 months on a scale of daily to not in the past three months. The responses from each individual provide a clear understanding of the frequency of their social engagement, which can provide valuable information when analyzing the relationship with their mental health ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b) WELLNESS_self_rated_mental_health** (Dependent Variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "This variable measures individuals' perception of their own mental health on a scale from poor to excellent. Because the scale is very detailed, it will provide detailed results on how social interactions impact mental health. This variable also highlights how mental health varies among different groups of people, which is important for my analysis of the overall population. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization Method: Bar Plot**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the data I am using is ordinal (categorical), the best visualization method would be a bar plot, which will effectively display the average self-rated mental health scores for each frequency category of family member interactions and provide a clear comparison of mental health score variations across different family interaction frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method: Simple Linear Regression** to analyze the relationship between the frequency of visiting family members and self-rated mental health. This will help determine the extent to which family visits account for the variation in mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process**: In my Simple Linear Regression model, I will set the CONNECTION_activities_visited_family_p3m to be the independent variable and WELLNESS_self_rated_mental_health to be the dependent variable, which will demonstrate how self-rated mental health depends (if it does) on the frequency of family visits. Then, I will encode the ordinal data of both variables by assigning numbers to the mental health ratings and family visit frequencies. Next, I will build the simple linear regression model and analyze the regression coefficients like the slope to determine if an increase in visit frequencies improves mental health, and use the y-intercept as the baseline mental health level for the lowest frequency of social visits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions**: The relationship between the frequency of family visits (independent variable) and self-rated mental health scores (dependent variable) is linear; each observation is linearly independent; the errors are normally distributed, homoscedastic, and statistically independent; and the sample is a representation of the Canadian population.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.Null Hypothesis:** There is no significant relationship (slope = 0) between family visit frequency and individuals' self-rated mental health scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative Hypothesis:** There is a positive relationship between family visit frequency and self-rated mental health scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that my linear regression model will reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis, showing a positive linear slope. This would indicate that increased frequency of family visits increases the self-rated mental health scores, directly addressing the research question—\"How does the frequency of visiting family members relate to the mental health of Canadians?.\" If confirmed by statistical evidence, the results will highlight the importance of maintaining familial connections for mental health and address one of the course project's objectives.\n",

    "### Analysis Proposal II: Relationship Between Community Service and Life Satisfaction\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.Research Question:** How does the frequency of community service relate to Canadians' life satisfaction?\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**a) CONNECTION_activities_community_p3m** (Independent Variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "This variable categorizes the frequency of community engagement in the past 3 months on a scale of daily a week to not in the past three months, using ordinal data. It is important in reflecting the levels of community engagement that may influence life satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)WELLNESS_life_satisfaction** (Dependent Variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "This variable measures individuals' life satisfaction on a numerical scale of 1 to 10, quantifying individuals' assessments of well-being and satisfaction. The variable is important for evaluating how life satisfaction changes with different levels of community engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization Method:Box Plot** A box plot would be useful in visualizing the data as it will effectively summarize statistics like the median, quartiles, and highlight outliers, which is important in identifying trends. I will also compute summary statistics like the mean and the median to understand the central tendency and spread of life satisfaction scores for each category of community service frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.Method: Simple Linear Regression**\n",
    "To analyze how the frequency of community service relates to life satisfaction ratings, I will construct a simple linear regression model. I will begin by encoding my independent variable, CONNECTION_activities_community_p3m into numerical values, fit a single regression model to my data, and then analyze the regression coefficients like the slope to determine if an increase in community engagement leads to an increase in life satisfaction and vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:** The relationship between community service frequency and life satisfaction is linear, observations are linearly independent, and the errors are normally distributed, homoscedastic, and statistically independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.Null Hypothesis:** There is no significant relationship (slope = 0) between community service frequency and Canadians' life satisfaction scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative Hypothesis**: There is a positive relationship between community service frequency and Canadians' life satisfaction scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "I expect to see in my results a positive slope, which indicates a positive relationship between community service frequency and life satisfaction. Therefore, these findings could highlight the importance of engaging in community service for personal happiness and life satisfaction, meeting another of the course project's objective\n",

    "### Analysis Proposal III:  Relationship between Feelings of Anxiety and Loneliness from Rejection and Physical Health\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Research Question:** What is the relationship between feelings of anxiety and loneliness from rejection and physical health? \n",
    "\n",
    "**2.Variables**: \n",
    "\n",
    "**WELLNESS_gad_anxious and LONELY_dejong_emotional_social_loneliness_scale_rejected (Independent Variables) and WELLNESS_self_rated_physical_health (Dependent Variable)**\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose WELLNESS_gad_anxious andLONELY_dejong_emotional_social_loneliness_scale_rejected  to be the dependent variables as they represent both the anxiety mental health factor and feelings of loneliness from societal rejection, which I believe could have an impact on physical health. By exploring these variables, I can analyze their relationship with people's perception of their physical health and determine if there is a correlation. I picked WELLNESS_self_rated_physical_health to be the dependent variable as it is an ordinal measure of physical health scores and it allows me to examine how physical health varies across different anxiety and loneliness levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization Method: Bar plots** would be an effective visualization method in this scenario, as they will effectively demonstrate the relationship between physical health scores and loneliness and anxiety levels, allowing for easier comparisons of these categorical data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Method: Multiple Linear Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Linear Regression is an effective method to analyze my data, which has two independent and one dependent variable. I will first begin my analysis process by encoding all my categorical variables and assigning them numerical values. I will then set WELLNESS_self_rated_physical_health as the dependent variable and WELLNESS_gad_anxious and LONELY_dejong_emotional_social_loneliness_scale_rejected as my independent variables to build the multiple linear regression model. Following that, I will analyze the regression coefficients like the slope and the y-intercepy to understand how changes in anxiety and loneliness levels are associated with changes in self-rated physical health scores to help me derive meaningful conclusions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions**: The relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear, the errors are normally distributed and homoscedastic, and the observations are independent. \n",
    "\n",
    "**4.Null Hypothesis:** There is no significant relationship (slope = 0) between feelings of anxiety and loneliness from rejection and the self-rated physical health of Canadians.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative Hypothesis:** There is a significant relationship between feelings of anxiety and loneliness from rejection and the physical health of Canadians.\n",
    "\n",
    "My predicted results for this research question would be a negative relationship (slope=-) between feelings of anxiety and loneliness from rejection and physical health. I expect higher levels of loneliness and anxiety to correlate with lower levels of physical health. If proved by statistical evidence, my findings would therefore reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis. These findings would also be useful for the course project in analyzing how anxiety and feelings of loneliness from societal rejection negatively impact individuals. \n",
